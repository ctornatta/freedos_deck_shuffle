# Overview

After watching Jim Hall's excellent Free DOS programming tutorial on how to write a Solitaire game [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zczmAkd8mvA) I decided to expand on the idea. 

Changes:

* Moved a number of sections into their own functions (print deck, etc..)
* Instead of using `X` to represent the `10` card I represented the card as a `10`.
* Cleaned up output to make it easier to read
* Created a `Makefile` to make compiling easier

I am sure it can be written much better. This was done strictly for fun and learning.
